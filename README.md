## üîç How the Math Works (Step by Step)

This section shows exactly how each number is calculated.  
We‚Äôll use these example results:

- Average Load (Sleep Mode): 0.613 Wh/hr ‚Üí 14.72 Wh/day  
- Average Load (No-Sleep Mode): 2.670 Wh/hr ‚Üí 64.08 Wh/day  
- Battery Requirement (Sleep Mode): 4.84 Ah @ 12 V ‚Üí 58.1 Wh stored  
- Battery Pack Configuration: 4 cells in series √ó 2 parallel (LiFePO‚ÇÑ 3.2 V, 3.2 Ah each)

### 1. Per-component power
For each component you enter:
- Voltage = `V`
- Sleep current = `I_sleep` (mA)
- Awake current = `I_awake` (mA)

Power in each state:
- Awake power (W):  
  \[
  P_\text{awake} = V \times \frac{I_\text{awake}}{1000}
  \]
- Sleep power (W):  
  \[
  P_\text{sleep} = V \times \frac{I_\text{sleep}}{1000}
  \]

We do this for every row (Pi, ESP32, sensors, etc.) and sum them.

### 2. Duty cycle weighting
You tell the tool:
- `Awake per cycle (min)` = \( t_\text{awake} \)
- `Sleep per cycle (min)` = \( t_\text{sleep} \)
- `Cycle length (min)` = \( t_\text{awake} + t_\text{sleep} \)

We convert those to fractions of time:
\[
f_\text{awake} = \frac{t_\text{awake}}{t_\text{awake} + t_\text{sleep}}
\]
\[
f_\text{sleep} = \frac{t_\text{sleep}}{t_\text{awake} + t_\text{sleep}}
\]

Example (10 min cycle, 2 min awake, 8 min sleep):
\[
f_\text{awake} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2
\quad,\quad
f_\text{sleep} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
\]

Now we compute the **time-weighted average power** of each component:
\[
P_\text{avg,component} = P_\text{awake} \times f_\text{awake} \;+\; P_\text{sleep} \times f_\text{sleep}
\]

Then we add all components to get **system average power**:
\[
P_\text{avg,total} = \sum P_\text{avg,component}
\]

That total is what we report as:
> **Average Load (Sleep Mode)** in Wh/hr  
(it‚Äôs effectively Watts, i.e. Watt-hours per hour)

In your example:
\[
P_\text{avg,total} = 0.613 \text{ Wh/hr}
\]

#### No-Sleep Mode
For ‚ÄúNo-Sleep Mode‚Äù, we assume every component is awake 100% of the time:
\[
P_\text{nosleep,total} = \sum \left(V \times \frac{I_\text{awake}}{1000}\right)
\]
That gave:
\[
P_\text{nosleep,total} = 2.670 \text{ Wh/hr}
\]

### 3. Daily energy use (Wh/day)
We multiply by 24 hours:
\[
\text{Wh/day} = \text{(Wh/hr)} \times 24
\]

So:
\[
0.613 \times 24 = 14.72 \text{ Wh/day}
\]
\[
2.670 \times 24 = 64.08 \text{ Wh/day}
\]

### 4. Energy savings from sleep mode
We show how much energy you save vs running everything awake 24/7:
\[
\text{Savings \%} =
\left(
1 - \frac{\text{Sleep Wh/day}}{\text{No-Sleep Wh/day}}
\right) \times 100
\]

Plugging in:
\[
\left(
1 - \frac{14.72}{64.08}
\right)\times 100
= 77.0\%
\]

So sleep mode cuts your daily energy by ~77%.

### 5. Battery capacity required (Ah)
You tell the tool:
- Autonomy (days with no sun) = \( D \)
- Depth of Discharge (DoD, e.g. 80% = 0.8)
- Battery efficiency (e.g. 95% = 0.95)
- Battery bus voltage \( V_\text{bus} \) (e.g. 12 V or 12.8 V)

First we find total watt-hours you need to survive:
\[
E_\text{total} = \text{Wh/day} \times D
\]

Then we account for usable fraction of the battery:
\[
\text{usable fraction} = \text{DoD} \times \text{efficiency}
\]

Then convert required watt-hours into required amp-hours:
\[
\text{Battery Ah} =
\frac{E_\text{total}}{V_\text{bus} \times \text{usable fraction}}
\]

Using your numbers:
- Daily Wh/day (Sleep Mode) = 14.72
- Autonomy = 2 days (example)
- DoD = 80% = 0.8
- Efficiency = 95% = 0.95
- Bus voltage = 12 V (‚âà 12.8 V nominal 4S LiFePO‚ÇÑ)

Step 1:
\[
E_\text{total} = 14.72 \times 2 = 29.44 \text{ Wh}
\]

Step 2:
\[
\text{usable fraction} = 0.8 \times 0.95 = 0.76
\]

Step 3:
\[
\text{Battery Ah} =
\frac{29.44}{12 \times 0.76}
\approx 4.84 \text{ Ah}
\]

That becomes:
> `Battery Requirement (Sleep Mode): 4.84 Ah @ 12 V ‚Üí 58.1 Wh stored`

Note: ‚Äú58.1 Wh stored‚Äù is just Ah √ó Vbus:
\[
4.84 \text{ Ah} \times 12 \text{ V} \approx 58.1 \text{ Wh}
\]

### 6. Battery pack configuration (series √ó parallel)
You also enter:
- Cell chemistry voltage (LiFePO‚ÇÑ = 3.2 V/cell)
- Cell capacity (e.g. 3.2 Ah per cell)

**Series cells** needed:
We figure out how many cells you need in series to reach your bus voltage:
\[
N_\text{series} = \left\lceil \frac{V_\text{bus}}{V_\text{cell}} \right\rceil
\]

For LiFePO‚ÇÑ:
- Cell ‚âà 3.2 V
- Bus ‚âà 12.8 V
\[
N_\text{series} = \lceil 12.8 / 3.2 \rceil = \lceil 4 \rceil = 4
\]
That gives you a 4S pack (~12.8 V nominal).

**Parallel strings** needed:
We check how many in parallel are needed to meet the Ah requirement:
\[
N_\text{parallel} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{Required Ah}}{\text{Cell Ah}} \right\rceil
\]

Example:
- Required Ah: 4.84 Ah
- Each cell: 3.2 Ah
\[
N_\text{parallel} = \lceil 4.84 / 3.2 \rceil = \lceil 1.51 \rceil = 2
\]

So you need **2 parallel strings** of those 4 cells.

Final pack:
\[
4\text{S} \times 2\text{P} = 8 \text{ cells total}
\]

We present that as:
> `4 cells in series √ó 2 parallel = 8 cells total (3.2 V / 3.2 Ah each)`

This also tells you what BMS you need:
- Because it‚Äôs 4 cells in series ‚Üí you need a **4S LiFePO‚ÇÑ BMS**
- Because you have 2P ‚Üí the current capability is higher, so pick a BMS with enough continuous current rating

### 7. Solar panel sizing
We know the daily energy the node needs (Wh/day).  
We also know:
- "System Eff. PV‚Üíload (%)": efficiency from sunlight through charge controller into battery and into load.
- "Sun Hours / day": effective full-sun hours (e.g. 7)

We compute how many watt-hours the panel must deliver per day:
\[
\text{Panel Wh/day} =
\frac{\text{Load Wh/day}}{\text{System Efficiency}}
\]

Then turn that into panel watts:
\[
\text{Panel W}_\text{ideal} =
\frac{\text{Panel Wh/day}}{\text{Sun Hours/day}}
\]

Then we double it (2√ó rule) for safety:
\[
\text{Panel W}_\text{recommended} = 2 \times \text{Panel W}_\text{ideal}
\]

So the tool prints both:
- the calculated panel size
- the recommended ‚Äú2√ó‚Äù panel size you should actually buy
